    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building your own Python package is easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- make a folder where you will store your package\n",
    "- create the relevant configuration files\n",
    "- write the code you want your package to contain\n",
    "- `pip` install it\n",
    "\n",
    "We go over these steps here, and then you should **practice**.\n",

    "## What is a Python package?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python package is an ensemble of functions that serve a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library of functions is often split into multiple files, containing subset of functions, the split follows common sense. \n",
    "Each subset/file is often referred to as a *module*. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a well-maintained package is [getdist](https://github.com/cmbant/getdist).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Click on [getdist](https://github.com/cmbant/getdist) and look inside the repository. \n",
    "Identify the configuration files and modules. \n",

    "## The folder structure of a Python package\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal package structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is simple. A minimal package file structure would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ".\n",
    "├── pyproject.toml               # Configuration \n",
    "├── README.md                    # Instructions\n",
    "├── package_name/                # Package folder with codes\n",
    "│   ├── __init__.py\n",
    "│   ├── module1.py\n",

    "└── tests/                       # Test files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover `dist` `test` and `docs` later. And you can ignore this for now and focus on the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"exercise-box\">\n",
    "**Exercise:** Create a folder called `my_package` and create the minimal file structure above with a simple `module1.py` file.\n",
    "The `module1.py` file should contain a simple function `print_name` that prints \"Hello, `<your name>`!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you should be able to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "from inside the package folder to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in a python session you should be able to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import package_name as mypkg\n",
    "mypkg.print_name()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and it should print \"Hello, `<your name>`!\".\n",

    "### Package development\n",
    "\n",
    "With this good starting point, we can now start developing the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us do an example and implement a new class `MedicalCompany` that inherits from the base `Company` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a submodule `medical`, as a folder `medical`, with an `__init__.py` file and a `medical.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our tree structure now looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "company_package/\n",
    "├── README.md\n",
    "├── company\n",
    "│   ├── __init__.py\n",
    "│   ├── base_company.py\n",
    "│   ├── version.py\n",
    "│   ├── medical\n",
    "│   │   ├── __init__.py\n",
    "│   │   └── medical.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relative imports\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The core code of our package defines some class in the `base_company.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the submodule, we define daughter classes that inherit from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, at the top of the `medical.py` file, we import the base class, and everything else we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from ..base_company import Company\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, with `..` we go up one level in the folder structure and ask to import the \n",
    "`Company` class that is defined in the `base_company.py` file. \n",
    "This is an example of a **relative import**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we also import `pandas` which is useful in this sub_module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python classes generally have an initialisation method `__init__` that sets up the **object** (also called **instance**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is called **initializer** or **constructor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a **method** which means it is a function that depends on some parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in our `base_company.py` file, we defined the `Company` class constructor as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Company:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, ticker=None):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Initialize a Company instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        - name (str): Name of the company.\n",
    "        - ticker (str): Stock ticker symbol if the company is publicly traded.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.ticker = ticker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters passing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [example above](#Class-constructor), the `self` parameter is a reference to the instance of the class. It must be there. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `name` and `ticker` parameters are used to set the **attributes** of the instance, as can be seen in the constructor body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `ticker` is presented with an equal sign and a default value, it is called an **optional** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `name` is not presented in such a way, so it is a **required** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to use two additional parameters objects: `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `*args` is used to pass a variable number of positional arguments to the constructor.\n",
    "- `**kwargs` is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see an example to see how this works and why it can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a method to the `Company` class that takes `*args` and `**kwargs` as arguments, whose purpose\n",
    "is to summarize activties of the company based on info provided in `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Company:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def summarize_activity(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",

    "        - *args: A list of activities related to the company.\n",
